# Big-O notation

Big-O gives an upper bound on the complexity in the **worst** case to quantify performance as input size becomes arbitrarily large.

* Constant Time: **O(1)**
* Logarithmic Time: **O(log(n))**
* Linear Time: **O(n)**
* Linearithnic Time: **O(nlog(n))**
* Quadric Time: **O(n^2)**
* Cubic Time: **O(n^3)**
* Exponential Time: **O(b^n)**, b > 1
* Factorial Time: **O(n!)**

# Big-O properties

* O(n+c) = O(n)
* O(cn)A = O(n), c > 0
* A function f(n) will be simplified to only the worst factor.
